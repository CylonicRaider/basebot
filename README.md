# basebot

Simplicistic library for [euphoria.io](http://euphoria.io/) bots;
with examples.

The actual library consists only of the `basebot.py` file (it depends
on [`websocket-client`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client/),
though); the other ones are examples.

For documentation, look at the docstrings with your favorite means
(`pydoc basebot`, `python -c 'import basebot; help(basebot)`,
`cat basebot.py`, *etc.*).

*Have fun!*
