# basebot

Moderately sophisticated library for [Euphoria](http://euphoria.leet.nu/)
bots.

The actual library consists only of the `basebot.py` file (it depends
on [`websocket-server`](https://github.com/CylonicRaider/websocket-server/),
though, which is provided as a submodule for convenience); the other files
are examples.

For documentation, look at [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) for an introduction, and
the docstrings with your favorite means (`pydoc basebot`,
`python -c 'import basebot; help(basebot)'`, `cat basebot.py`, *etc.*) for a
thorough reference. For a quick start guide, consider [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

*Have fun!*
