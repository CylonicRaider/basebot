# basebot

Simplicistic library for [euphoria.io](http://euphoria.io/) bots;
with examples.

*The library is a public release candidate now! Please still report any
bugs or issues you can find!*

The actual library consists only of the `basebot.py` file (it depends
on [`websocket-server`](https://github.com/CylonicRaider/websocket-server/),
though, which is provided as a submodule for convenience); the other ones
are examples.

For documentation, look at the docstrings with your favorite means
(`pydoc basebot`, `python -c 'import basebot; help(basebot)'`,
`cat basebot.py`, *etc.*). For a quick start guide, check out
[MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md).

*Have fun!*
