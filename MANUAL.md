# basebot programmer's manual

## Abstract

This document provides an overview over the entry points into writing bots
using `basebot`.

## Introduction

`basebot` supports two approaches to writing bots, a [procedural](#minibot)
and an [object-oriented](#bot) one. Both are equivalently powerful; however,
although simple bots are written quickly using the procedural approach,
implementing more complex functionality in it can become ugly as quickly.

## Further reading

The inline documentation of [basebot.py](basebot.py) provides a thorough
reference of all components included.
